# Chicken Abattoir

OSRS bot for slaughtering chickens and looting their remains! This was heavily built on my [chicken feather picker](https://github.com/df329/chicken-feather-picker).

## Getting started

1. **Recommend**: auto-retaliate is ON
2. **Recommend**: set and check your attack style
3. Start the script at Lumbridge chicken farm inside the gate!

### Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/df329/chicken-abattoir.git
```
