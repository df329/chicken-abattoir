# Chicken Abattoir

OSRS bot for slaughtering chickens and looting their remains! This was heavily built on my [chicken feather picker](https://github.com/df329/chicken-feather-picker).

## Getting started

1. **Recommend**: auto-retaliate is ON
2. **Recommend**: set and check your attack style
3. Start the script at Lumbridge chicken farm inside the gate!

### Cloning

```bash
git clone https://github.com/df329/chicken-abattoir.git
```

## Future

* Some randomness for anti-ban
  * Camera rotation
  * Mouse movements
  * Walking/idle actions
* Attack mode configuration
* Door/gate issues
  * Difficult, probably some localization needed
* Maybe cooking food
* Maybe bury bones
* Display combat statistics

## Known limitations

* Picking up feathers is mandatory for now
